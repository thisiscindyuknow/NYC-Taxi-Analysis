# NYC-Taxi-Analysis
How can the yellow taxi industry in New York City address the challenge of decreasing demand?

# Introduction
The goal of our project is to achieve efficient allocation of cabs, provide data-driven recommendations based on thorough analysis, and ensure the future sustainability of the iconic yellow taxi industry in New York City. Through our research and findings, we aim to optimize the allocation of taxis, enhance their operational efficiency, and propose data-backed strategies to improve the overall performance of the yellow taxi system. By doing so, we seek to secure the long-term viability and success of the yellow taxi industry, maintaining its iconic status within the city.

In addition to the TLC Trip Record Data, we utilized the Taxi Zone Lookup Table to enhance our analysis. This table contains essential details such as LocationID, Borough, Zone, and service zone for each taxi trip. By incorporating this information, we gain valuable insights into the geographical distribution of taxi trips throughout New York City. This enriched dataset enables us to better comprehend and analyze the spatial patterns and trends within the taxi industry.

In order to compare the performance of yellow taxis with that of their ride-hailing competitors, we utilized the High-Volume For-Hire Vehicle Records dataset, which includes trip-level data for Uber and Lyft in New York City.
